Adding background music to your server couldn't be easier!

6. select your music folder (c:\tm_music)
7. select [File] --> [Save]
8. Upload your music folder to web provider (ftp, sftp, scp, whatever)

9. test that the music files and index.csv are accessible by visiting your uploaded music folder..
   (or see example of the files at http://reaby.kapsi.fi/ml/musictest)

replace the address with your music url folder, but you can use this to test that the plugin works.

incase you don't have windows or dont' want to run musicmanager you can create the music index
file manually, see example at http://reaby.kapsi.fi/ml/musictest/index.csv

You can edit easily the file with excel or openoffice calc
